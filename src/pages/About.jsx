      <p>
        Well, since you're quite curious about me, I'll indulge you! 👀<br /><br />
        I'm a passionate developer who enjoys building web apps 
        that are both functional and visually engaging. 
        I love combining logic and creativity to solve problems, 
        and I'm driven by the impact technology can have on real people’s lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although I've always wanted to design web pages, I realized that
        it takes continuous learning, consistent effort, and real-world experience.
        That's why this portfolio exists — to showcase my growth and what I'm working on.

        So if you'd like to follow along with my journey, keep your eyes on this space! 👩🏽‍💻
